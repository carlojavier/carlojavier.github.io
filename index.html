                <p>
                  Perpetual storyteller bringing the people-first elements of journalism, communications, and advocacy
                  to web development. I'm fascinated with how code can open new horizons for delivering the stories 
                  that matter and the programs that help people be better informed. When I'm not in front of a screen, 
                  I like to cook, write short stories, and shoot three-pointers.
