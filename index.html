                <p>
                    Perpetual storyteller and lifelong learner.
                    Web Developer with foundations rooted in communications, journalism, and advocacy.
                    I approach every venture with a holistic mindset, implementing lessons and skills
                    acquired from previous experiences with each and every project on hand.
                    Always fascinated with how code and a smartly designed program can help us be better people.
                    When I'm not coding, I like to write short stories, shoot three pointers, and make magic in the
                    kitchen.
