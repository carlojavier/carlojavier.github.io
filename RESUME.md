## TAGLINE

Perpetual storyteller and lifelong learner. Web Developer with foundations rooted in communications, journalism, and advocacy. I approach every venture with a holistic mindset, implementing lessons and skills acquired from previous experiences with each and every project on hand. Always fascinated with how code and a smartly designed program can help us be better people. When I'm not coding, I like to write short stories, shoot three pointers, and make magic in the kitchen.
